## The Potato Leaf Disease Detection project uses computer vision and machine learning to identify and classify diseases affecting potato plants based on images of their leaves. It involves collecting a dataset of healthy and diseased potato leaf images, preprocessing the data, training a model like CNN to classify the images, and then deploying the model in an application. This system helps farmers quickly detect and diagnose diseases like late blight or early blight, allowing them to take timely action and prevent crop loss.
