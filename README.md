**Potato Leaf Disease Detection using Computer Vision and Machine Learning**

**Project Overview**
This project leverages computer vision and machine learning to automatically detect and classify diseases in potato plants based on leaf images. By analyzing patterns in leaf conditions, the system can help farmers identify diseases early, such as **Late Blight** or **Early Blight**, to reduce crop loss and improve agricultural outcomes.

**Key Features**

* Image-based classification of potato leaf diseases
* Accurate identification of common diseases like Late Blight and Early Blight
* Preprocessing pipeline for image enhancement and normalization
* Deep learning model (CNN) trained on real-world leaf datasets
* Web application for users to upload leaf images and receive results instantly

**Technologies Used**

* **Machine Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries & Tools:** TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Deployment:**  Streamlit (or mention what you used)
* **Dataset:** Healthy and diseased potato leaf images (public or custom dataset)

**Purpose**

The goal is to build an accessible tool that assists farmers in diagnosing potato leaf diseases early by simply uploading an image, enabling faster decision-making and reducing reliance on expert consultation.

**Project Workflow**

1. **Data Collection:** Healthy and diseased leaf images
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, augmentation
3. **Model Training:** CNN-based architecture with classification layers
4. **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision, confusion matrix
5. **Deployment:** User interface for image input and prediction output

**Future Enhancements**

* Expand to other crops and diseases
* Mobile app version for on-field use
* Real-time image capture and prediction using camera integration
* Multilingual support for farmer accessibility
## Dataset

The dataset is available in `dataset(2).zip`as it is too large to add so i upload a zip file here.  
To use it, unzip it after cloning the repository:

```bash
unzip dataset(2).zip
